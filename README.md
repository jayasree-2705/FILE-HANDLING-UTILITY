## üìÑ Description

The **FileHandlingUtility** is a simple yet effective Java-based utility class designed to perform fundamental file operations such as reading from and writing to text files. It encapsulates core functionality for interacting with the file system and offers reusable methods that can be easily integrated into larger applications or used as a standalone tool for basic file manipulation.

The utility is particularly useful in educational projects, small-scale Java applications, scripting scenarios, or as a starter module for understanding Java I/O (Input/Output) stream operations. Built with clarity and modularity in mind, the code focuses on demonstrating best practices in Java programming related to file operations while maintaining readability and simplicity.

This utility handles common file handling tasks:
- Reading the contents of a file line by line and printing it to the console.
- Writing a string to a file using `FileWriter`.
- Demonstrating the use of buffered I/O for improved efficiency.
- Handling exceptions effectively using `try-catch` blocks and ensuring resources are properly managed with `finally` blocks or try-with-resources.

It uses the Java I/O package (`java.io`) and adheres to conventional Java patterns and coding standards. This utility can be extended or customized further to handle more complex file operations such as appending content, working with binary files, or integrating logging mechanisms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

### Programming Language
- **Java SE (Standard Edition)**: Core language used for writing the utility. The program utilizes core Java features without any external dependencies.

### IDE / Editor (Optional but recommended)
- **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **VS Code**: Any modern Java IDE can be used to run and edit this code efficiently.

### Java Libraries
- **java.io.FileReader**: For reading character files.
- **java.io.FileWriter**: For writing character data to files.
- **java.io.BufferedReader**: For efficient line-by-line reading of a file.
- **java.io.BufferedWriter**: For writing text efficiently to a file.
- **java.io.IOException**: For handling input/output-related exceptions.

### Version
- Java 8 or later is recommended to compile and run the program.

## üåç Where This Is Used (Use Cases)

This utility can be used in a wide range of scenarios, including:

### üîπ Educational Purposes
- Great for beginners learning Java file handling.
- Demonstrates practical implementation of Java I/O classes.
- Provides hands-on understanding of reading and writing files, exception handling, and stream management.

### üîπ Data Processing Scripts
- Can be used in small scripts that require reading configuration files, log files, or data files.
- Writing output reports or results to text files.

### üîπ Project Utilities
- Acts as a base utility class for larger software applications.
- Useful for storing logs, exporting data, or reading templates from files.

### üîπ Automation Tools
- A good fit for use in automation tools where file-based configuration or reporting is needed.
- Can be extended to support batch operations on multiple files.

### üîπ Lightweight Microservices or CLIs
- If you are building a command-line utility in Java that interacts with the file system, this utility serves as a useful module.
- Could be integrated into applications requiring file ingestion from external sources.
